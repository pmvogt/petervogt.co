# Personal site + portfolio - Peter Vogt

This is the latest version of my portfolio site. It's here to demonstrate some of my competencies and experience in sotware design and development and serves as a small-scope personal blog.

## Stack

- Planned, designed, and meticulously pixel-pushed with [Figma](https://figma.com) using a design system I created for personal projects for myself, [Hoxton](https://www.figma.com/proto/rmbjZK4XXjbzlP4eNVhpdE/Hoxton---Tokens-%26-Primitives?node-id=172%3A282).
- [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/docs/getting-started) provides the bundling, static page generation and deployed/hosted using [Vercel](https://vercel.com).
- [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com) powers all of the styling, with a config file extended to match my design system tokens + primitives.
- Animation effects were made using [framer-motion](https://www.framer.com/docs/introduction/) which has been used for animations in almost every React project I've ever made.
- [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) is used in content pages, which allows for a consistent and easy writing experience with the capabilities of JSX built in.

## Acknowlegements

I'd like to acknowledge that my career has been a journey that has taken a village beyond just myself. I don't have a CS or design degree and never was the beneficiary of a Stanford -> FAANG internship pipeline or anything like that. What I have been blessed with are a lot of folks who have helped me round out my skills. I grew up playing in bands and will always be a big "liner notes" guy. So in lieu of contributor or donor recognition in this portfolio project I'd like to thank: CJ Keeney, David Wirth, Quantarius Ray, AJ Klein, Bryan Eslinger, Marcelo Reyna, Sean Malone, Kaleb Trotter, Ryan Lease, Ashlae Nelms-Long, Ian Smith, Jared Cook, Mark McCann and Ian Dickerson for being patient and thoughtful with me through all of the pairing and Slack questions that got me to the point where I can reliably put an app together.

From the design side of the house from the bottom of my heart I extend gratitude to Josh Boyd, Kim Harris, Emily Diersing, Anne Grundhoefer, Josh Christopher, Sarah Leick, Ryan & Rayn Breault, Jesslyn Beattie, ZÃ¡bdiel Gonzalez, Matt Hyndman, Charlie Trotter, Renee Blostein, Lan Johnson, Chelsea Soprano, Danny Farmer, Mike Parra, Sarah Xiong, Nick Andreoli, Eric Cuellar, David James, Kate Chaparro, Eric Leckband, and Kelly Hanner. If you are on these lists I appreciate the help and support you have given me throughout my career, and I am better for having collaborated with you in one form or another.
