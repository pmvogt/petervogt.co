## Summary

USAA is a Fortune 100 financial services provider (primarily banking and insurance) for veterans and active US military, and their family members. They are headquartered in San Antonio, Texas USA. I worked in the Plano, Texas office until March 2020 and have been full-time remote since.

Since 2019, I've been supporting USAA's insurance line of business. The first project
I joined was codenamed Apollo, an IoT command and control native app for policyholding
USAA members. After the project was shuttered early on in development, I moved on
to co-owning the design effort for an internal compliance tracker web app with Lead
Designer Josh Boyd, and have flexed across USAA design teams in various user research
and "art of the possible" type efforts for VP and C level executives in USAA Insurance.

I've also contributed to the USAA design system and UI component library, with both
design and development assets in production. I am a firm believer in community maintained
design systems and it's important to me that designers can help shape their design
system rather than simply be burdened by the constraints of it in a scaled design
org.

## USAA Connected Home

USAA Connected Home was initially a very large effort. A designer was allocated for both Android and
iOS platforms on our team, and one of my responsibilties was conducting research with the native
designers and testing the team's conclusions against prototypes I built in React Native.
Additionally, I contributed to shoring up communication barriers between designers and developers
and creating a pattern library for USAA Connected Home extended from the official USAA design
system.

### Problem Spaces

<div className="space-between flex flex-col md:flex-row">
  <div className="pl-8 pt-1">
    <ul className="list-disc mt-4 md:mt-0">
      <li>
        Privacy - how might we operate in a transparency-first model in regard to telemetric data
        collection?
      </li>
      <li>
        Compliance - how might we ensure the Connected Home enrollment process is thoroughly in
        compliance with state and federal laws in member states, and how do we communicate that
        without overwhelming the member?
      </li>
      <li>
        Breadth of liability - how might we communicate the proper level of localized risk of
        flooding, wildfires, etc - to members?
      </li>
      <li>Multiple policies - how might we account for members with several homeowner policies?</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
</div>

### Usability testing with “the real thing”

One of the biggest challenges the team were having was the absence of native OS
functionality in their prototypes. USAA had a strict InVision and Sketch only
workflow that limited bringing in advanced design tools to simulate haptic feedback,
user input with a keyboard, and testing for accessibility compliance for mobile
users. In addition to facilitating HCD workshops and shaping UX at the feature
level, I also had a real pull to supercharge the design team's prototypes.

After about a week of deep diving in internal Wikis, project repos, and querying
Slack for similar problems teams have had, I'd found a gem. A lone developer had
done some proof of concepts for writing UI with React Native. Now I have a starting
point.

The first thing I do is get access to add React Native as a depency in a local
nodeJS environment. USAA doesn't use React Native in production, so I had to jump
through some hoops to do so. At previous employers, this would have been as simple
as installing Framer or Protopie. The security in enterprise financial services is a
whole different beast.

Normally I'd have been frustrated by that, but I'm appreciative of the opportunities
I got to learn how to make do with very finite resources and how to simply go _find_
the information that you're looking for in a big org.

### Pivoting from native app to storefront + enrollment UX

When the native app was shuttered, the product pivoted to a much simpler offering: USAA Connected Home became a benefit for members to enroll in to obtain discounts on IoT devices provided by our partner, Resideo (Honeywell Home), as well as a discount on their homeowner insurance policy.

The team fractioned off into different projects, while myself and two other designers took over the public-facing Connected Home site and member-facing enrollment flow. We used past member research on this topic that the team had in droves, and our prototypes were built as React front-ends that I built and maintained on my own.

### Design + Engineering partnership

A funny benefit of prototyping in code: sometimes your code ends up in production. Our public-facing page for the product and enrollment flow re-used the vast majority of presentational JSX and SCSS code I wrote for the prototypes. The public facing page is [here](https://www.usaa.com/my/connected-home?), and enrollment flow can be viewed if you have a USAA membership.

## AutoAdvance

{' '}
<div className="flex-col justify-start">
  <p className="mr-4">**Team**:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>**Mark McCann, Jared Cook, Ashlae Nelms-Long, Ian Smith, Ian Dickerson** - Developer</li>
    <li>**Peter Vogt** - Developer, Design Technologist</li>
    <li>**Chris Welch** - Designer</li>
  </ul>
  <div className="py-2">
    <p>**Project Type**:</p>
    <p>Dev component (React, VanillaJS, SCSS, Storybook)</p>
  </div>
</div>
In the summer of 2021, I was thrilled to be asked to help the design system developer team in the
form of a residency. The team was going through a top-down overhaul of the entire system, and they
were actively looking for folks to embed and help carry the load.

My first assignment was an entire component(!!!). And not just any component, but
a bit of an unorthodox one called AutoAdvance. The component was to be a group of
buttons that automatically "advances" to the next group of buttons. The context it's
most useful in are enrollment flows, quote flows, and questionnaires. "Tap and go"
is a name typically seen for experiences that leverage the AutoAdvance component
heavily.

Design of the component had already been done and completed by the time I joined
the devs, so all of that was a credit to Chris Welch.

### Hurdles & self-growth

-Imposter syndrome: How might I lean into my teammates to push through it?

-Git: How might I adapt to a routine-yet-specific developer team workflow that I'd never encountered before?

-Reusable VanillaJS and unit tests: most of the projects I'd built before leveraged React or at minimum some dependency like Bootstrap that handled much of the event delegation and lower-level component functionality. How might I learn to love the basics?

I will admit that I was intimidated. The team were very high performing and most of them had been working with each other for years. Almost all of the code I have written over my career was filled with shortcuts and imperfections, due to them being mostly destined for design reviews and usability testing rather than a production environment. Here, I was being asked to build an entire component for all of USAA front-end teams to have access to. Whole other ballgame.

The first challenge I had was getting used to the rebase versioning process the team used in Git. This is a pretty common
thing, but not something I'd worked in before. My teammate Ashlae in particular was so helpful in pairing on Zoom, and incredibly
patient with me. Now I can rebase commits like a pro.

Another challenge was learning to think + write in a pure Javascript mental model. You don't appreciate the level of abstraction React gives you until you have to target every element manually in the contstructor. Let the record show: when someone hammers on about "Learn pure JS before diving into React/Vue/whatever", in my experience - they're right!

### Results

In the end, AutoAdvance made it into production and my residency felt like a big personal win. When I feel the developer imposter syndrome beast lurking, I simply remind myself that I shipped an enterprise component to production. No, it wasn't easy, and no - that doesn't mean I'm an expert developer now. But with a lot of help from my peers and more sweat more than I would have liked to admit, we shipped it. I was a part of it all, even if just a little one. Nothing can take that feeling away.
