## Summary

In my career, I've been fortunate to have some incredible opportunities embedded in Design Systems teams.
At this point I have a pretty solid feel for the majority of problems - at least at a very high altitude - that DS teams solve both in service of their consumers, but also internally as a team. Adoption, evangelism, proactive community outreach, documentation, "Do we give them nothing but organisms/atoms or do we lock everything the hell down?"...and right, of course, building the actual components. That part is the real fun. That's what keeps me coming back.

Here, I'll walk through my perspective + approach to building a UI component for web or native apps in a couple of contexts in which I've done it: One, as the sole maintainer of the design library at $BIG_PRINT_COMPANY while at projekt202. The design system had already been built by some brilliant people before me, but it hadn't been put into implementation mode yet. Teams had built some vision UX work with it, but we were about to move into a 10 team product group as part of BigPrint's company-wide digital transformation effort (which projekt202 drove).

## File tree view (projekt202)

BigPrint, as the tongue-in-cheek-NDA-friendly name implies, specialized in providing DTC print items for consumers. So a "you give them your artwork they give you a poster with the art on it" type deal. We were re-building their in-house PoS software from the ground up, so you can imagine there were plenty of scenarios where file browsing/viewing/uploading is required. As the design system was mature already, we had the freedom to focus on some niche components like this, and this one was fun to take on.

### API-based design

I don't start with sketches or lo-fi work for components. Not really, anyway. It can help contextualize use cases which may give you a better picture at 40,000 feet - but really I'm thinking early about the functionality the team will need to provide. Specifically at the API label. I start to think: what does the props API table look like at the end of this?

A criticism of this workflow might be that we aren't starting with the end user in the mind, but I would disagree. For starters - it isn't about prioritizing how to build the best or simplest API instead of the best UI component - it's a matter of approaching component rendering as a byproduct of application state, and understanding that our final product as a design systems team has effectively two "customer groups". I think about how the user needs in our context might be X, the consumer teams needs might be Y, and the sweet spot our component needs to serve is Z.

It's probably no big shock what the file tree view is going to look like in the end. We have recurring patterns in design that make things familiar for people - Windows File Explorer and MacOS Finder appear _generally_ the same on the surface. The difference is in the specifics. Similarly, the file tree viewer we're building here will look like a bunch of others at a glance. **It's the implementation specifics that make the difference, and those begin and end in the API**. Figma assets and Sketch libraries mean nothing if they don't reflect the actual implementation accurately.

An outline forms in my notebook:

```js
--`id/key`: String
-`disabled`: bool
-`hasChildren`: bool
-`isOpen`: bool
-`isSelected`: bool
-`onOpen`: func
-`onSelect`: func
```

Right, this seems like table stakes level stuff at least. We want to handle event delegation, we want to provide state control, sure of course. But this is still pretty abstract: we don't want to _just_ provide the ability to disable the whole tree. We know from past UX research on the account that employees have wildly different permission levels and often run up against access problems with individual files. We'll have to provide the ability to disable a directory and individual files as well. So already we're likely to end up with:

```
-edl-tree
	-edl-tree-dir
		-edl-tree-file
```

_EDL is the acronym for the design system name_

In markup, "Coding in the real world"-type terms, that probably looks like:

```jsx
<edl-file-tree>
	<edl-tree-dir>
	{items.map(name) =>
		<edl-tree-file name={name} />
	}
	</edl-tree-dir>
</edl-file-tree>
```

It's a start. Envisioning the context when code gets written into the IDE and the genesis of a front-end is taking place really gives me a sense of grounding. I then start trying to think deeper about contexts: we're likely to want file name editing capability if a BigPrint employee needs to rename a customer's file, so isEditable makes sense as a potential boolean prop for `<edl-tree-dir/>` and `<edl-tree-file/>`. We probably want a callback there in case checks need to be made on filename formatting for example, so an `onEdit` callback is a decent bet to propose as well.

I go on completing this list of potential inputs and properties, making sure to get feedback, use-cases and contexts from the DS-consuming delivery teams. After all, they each have individual insight to bring to the table on the slices of the product they're working on. I bring this API proposal to design reviews just like anyone would a Figma prototype. At this point, the developers I'm working with haven't even seen it yet - I hope to come with them with the end in mind first.

### UI Design

Now we'll actually start thinking about how this compon ent looks. Since the design system is mature, there's no need to agonize too long over the basics.

I'll start at the atoms and organisms, thinking about each piece to this component and how they look with the API proposal I drew up prior. Thanks to the design system, we already had established global patterns and tokens for disabled elements, focused elements, etc.

It's starting to take shape, and I'll keep running through the API proposal and generating visual representations
in Figma. Eventually we end up right around here:

  alt="EDL Tree base components in Figma"

At this point is when I took edl-tree as a proposal to final signoff from the rest of the designers,
the DS engineers, and the PM leads.

### Design assets & SASS handoff

With teamwide signoff, it's time to start prepping deliverables. I made sure the Figma library assets were flexible and production ready:

  alt="EDL Tree Figma components"
  width={1203}
  height={2980}

/>

Then begin prepping some handoff docs, which will supplement both a codepen and Figma prototype I'll put together for the rest of the team:

And that's about the long and short of it, as they say.

## Segmented Toggle (USAA)

### Initial Research

Where the nuts and bolts were prioritized first with tree view, the segmented toggle component I concepted for USAA's design system team was a bit of a different situation. The system already had a tabs component, form groups, and other similar controls - we wanted to be judicious in how we built this component with specific use-cases in mind. We first wanted to establish as a team what the needs of our consumers is and how that intersects with industry standard implementations of a segmented toggle.

First we gathered some comps that were coupled directly with requests from design teams who asked for a segmented toggle.

  alt="Design system decision trees for when to use a segmented toggle"
  width={483}
  height={847}

  mdx
/>

The patterns were all pretty similar: most of them were used to filter pricing results on things like
quote flows for members. Things like "Monthly/Yearly" price comparisons, "Deposits/Withdrawls" in a bank
account statement view - lots of binary-ish design patterns.

We did research into open-source design system docs from companies like Lyft and Gitlab to see what their implementation guidance was. There was a lot of precedent here:

<CustomImage

  publicId="work/usaa/seg-toggle4.png"
  alt="Segmented contexts out in the wild"
  width={634}
  height={924}
  preview
  mdx
/>

And a lot of variance, too. We felt like Gitlab's decision table was a bit too broad for the scope of our work. The contexts in which we'd need it were probably much smaller - none of the designs we'd seen internally that asked for a segmented toggle had any more than two, in fact. Our own internal community feedback indicated that three options would be the most they'd need. This at least felt like a strong direction with flexibility to expand (with rationale) if we needed to.

### Nuts & bolts

USAA were still Sketch-first at the time, so my focus this time was preparing components for the Design System team's web library. From [my time as a guest developer](/usaa-insurance-and-design-system) on their dev team, I was familiar with the markup for their vanilla and React components and could present a proposal accordingly:

As mentioned above and I hope this work shows - this is the part I love the most.
