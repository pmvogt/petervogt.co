In the 90s, when personalized homepages were a mainstream fad, here is where I'd say "welcome to my little corner of the information superhighway". This journey stretches all the way back then, to when my father excitedly came home with our first PC - complete with the cow print Gateway box. Since then, I've been a lifelong Permanently Online(TM) type, and derive a lot of joy from designing and developing digital products. I first got hooked on this craft when I learned how to build [AOL proggies](https://charlesleifer.com/blog/a-stroll-down-memory-lane-scripting-aol/) thanks to my Mom's friend hooking me up with a copy of Visual Basic 4.0 (enterprise edition no less)!

I live with my wife who is the light of my life + our three rescue dogs in Texas, United States. I'm an avid gamer and former pop-punk/hardcore musician of many years. My areas of expertise are design systems, design tools, designer + engineer relations, modern UI dev best practices, and UX research. I currently work in USAA's Chief Design Office as Lead Designer for USAA's primary design system.

My resume is <a href="https://asset.cloudinary.com/dyc1seeg9/f9a3ab56d12c4eac8601ef26af5e0b64">here</a>. I'm available for consulting work, speaking engagements, and content partnerships. If you are struggling with your design career or are burnt out and just want to talk, my door is always open as well.
